# Backup Scripts

Scripts for backing up devices and servers in my house to a shared NAS system built on FreeBSD using a ZFS array. 

These scripts do _not_ back up the total system state for bare metal restore. Any additional configuration files should be managed using an automation system (ansible etc).
